\section{Scope Leaks}
CSS were created by the design Principle \gls{soc} with the intent to separate content and visual style.
In contrast to inline styles and embedded stylesheets they are reusable across different \gls{html} documents.
To this date, while some browsers support scoped \verb <style> -tags, the CSS scoping module level 1 is still in draft.\footnote{cf. \cite{cssscopingmodule}}\footnote{cf. \cite{styletag}}
This means that the rules of a referenced stylesheet apply to any part of the DOM if selectors are matched and the rule is not overwritten or shadowed.
When a stylesheet is viewed as a program that is executed with the \gls{dom} as context, the \gls{css}-rules may be viewed as impure functions executed in given order.
shadowing = collision

Similar to a program with impure functions, the modification of a stylesheet with of unscoped styles can have unforeseen side effects.
For example, when a change is made to a selector or the associated properties with the intention to modify the visual appearance of a specific element of the \gls{dom}, the rule created or modified can apply to other elements aswell.
This so called `scope leak'\footnote{cf. \cite{mpgcss}} can occur in any \gls{html}-Document that references this very stylesheet.
When the developer undertaking the changes is not aware of all applications of a specific rule, some of the visual changes are considered unforeseen.
The cascade and Specificity mechanism of \gls{css} adds some somplexity to possible side effects due to possible interactions between individual rules.
The risk of unforeseen side effects in the development of generally unscoped \gls{css} is increased with the size of the codebase and the number of developers.
This is due to the increased amount of knowledge required to foresee side effects. 
However, global or 'base' styles are not inherently considered harmful.
Their usage is suitable to provide representational consistency inside single aswell across multiple \gls{html} documents.\footnote{cf. \cite{mpgcss}}
Scoping makes sense to create exceptions aswell as styling more complex structures isolated structures within the DOM.
The effects of a change of scoped styles are easier to localize in comparison to unscoped styles.
So when the intended visual effect of a specific rule is not global, it makes sense to scope it in order to possibly reduce cognitive load for developers.

The aforementioned \gls{w3c}-draft on CSS scoping defines a syntax that is similar to that of media queries.
However, media queries no not operate based on the \gls{dom}-structure but are scoping styles based on various properties of the rendering device.\footnote{cf. \cite{mediaqueries}}
Here it is possible to surround a set of rules with a selector that, if matched, limits these rules' scope to children of the matched element.
\begin{verbatim}
    @scope div {
      span {
        color: blue;
      }
    }
\end{verbatim}
In terms of limiting the visibility of rules this has the exact same effect as prefixing it with that selector.\footnote{cf. \cite{cssscopingmodule}}

A selector chain with more than one selector scopes the rule by the first selector:
\begin{verbatim}
.sidebar span {
    background: red;
}
.sidebar a {
    color: blue;
}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\caption{The rules are scoped within the context of sidebar elements}
\end{figure}

The usage of this technique is often observed to limit the scope of styles to a specific page.
Coyier introduced and Escalante recommends decorating decorating the body tag of each \gls{html} document of a project with an ID.\footnote{cf. \cite{coyieridbody}}\footnote{cf. \cite{mpgcss}}
The major use case for page or page-type specific styles is the creation of visual exceptions among all pages.
Generally, page-specific styles may be used to define visual cues as visual orientation aids.
A concrete example for this is a visual design specification that distinguishes the header of an article page through a an opaque background instead of being  a transparent layer over a darker image.

\begin{verbatim}
header {
    background: transparent;
}
#article header {
    background: black;
}
\end{verbatim}

Coyier also exemplifies the use of page-specific styles through highlighting the currently selected entry of the main menu without changing the markup of the latter.

\begin{verbatim}

// index.html

<body id='about'>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li class='nav-item home'>
            <li class='nav-item about'>
        ...


// style.css

nav li {}

#about .nav-item.about {}

\end{verbatim}

However this technique should be applied with caution.
The markup and the styles in this example are coupled tightly and effectively violate the principle of \gls{soc}.
Each navigation entry requires an additional rule to function correctly in the context of the user interface.
Because this leads to bloat in \gls{css} code when the number of navigation entry is growing, a dynamic \gls{js} client- or server-side solution modifying the markup might be more when aiming for scalability.

The self-entitled styling methodologies \gls{bem} and \gls{suit} share the concept of creating indivisble blocks in both \gls{html} and \gls{css} in an isolated manner.
These blocks are referred to as `modules`\footnote{cf. \cite{bem}} or `components'\footnote{cf. \cite{suit}}.
\gls{suit} is inspired by and may be viewed as being evolved from \gls{suit}.
Both have very similar conventions for the construction of \gls{css} rule selectors and the related markup.
The following example displays the construction of component and child-element selectors in \gls{suit}.
snake/dash/camel case

\begin{verbatim}
.BlockName {}

.BlockName-descendantName {}
\end{verbatim}
Whereas the delimiters can be chosen freely in \gls{bem} the naming conventions are more specific for \gls{suit}.
The reason for capitalising the root node selector is to avoid name collisions and thus expectedly better integration with existing code.\footnote{cf. \cite{bemvssuitquestion}}
The example shows that the scoping here does not utilise the cascade but works through prefixing the actual class names.
Descendent styles are applied to elements decorated with the classname \verb ComponentName-descendantName , regardless of their position in the \gls{dom}.

Escalante criticises this approach.
Instead of leveraging the functionality of the cascade, \gls{bem} and \gls{suit} annul it to `replicate it [...] in a less efficient manner'.\footnote{\cite{mpgcss}}
Inheriting the class name of the block root into the class name of a descendant causes repetitition and thus redundancy in the \gls{html}.\footnote{cf. \cite{mpgcss}}
{\slshape Title CSS} leverages the cascade to create a scope.
Through separating the block identifier as distinct class, repetition within the \gls{html}-markup is avoided:

\begin{verbatim}
.BlockName {}

.BlockName .descendantName{}
\end{verbatim}
Besides avoiding repetition, Cuthbert adds ease-of-writing as well as readability as rationales for {\slshape Title CSS} as naming convention.
After presenting methods for avoiding scope leaks in \gls{css}, methods to avoid redundancy within \gls{css} files are presented in the following section.
