\section{Violations of the \acrlong{dry} Principle}
The \gls{dry} Principle was formulated in 2000 by Hunt and Thomas.
It states that 
`Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.'\footnote{\cite{pragmaticprogrammer} p. 27}
When we consider the following excerpt we can observe what is most likely a violation of \gls{dry}

\begin{verbatim}
button {
    color: red;
    padding: 5px;
}

a {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: none;
}
\end{verbatim}

Assuming that the intention of the developer was to give both links and buttons an identical color, this piece of knowledge has two authoritative representations here.
But it is possible that the red color may only be identical by coincidence, meaning that it different semantics within the context of either element.
This implies that both definitions will not necessarily be change at the same time.
However, if this is not the case, that repetition may cause additional cost during maintenance.
This is because, if the inherently singular piece of knowledge changes, the code has to be changed in more that one place.
Even automated tools like find and replace are prone to errors of their operators as the operation may require detailed knowledge of the target system.\footnote{cf. \cite{humanautomation} p.408}

There are multiple options to eliminating the problem that has just been examined.
Variables are, to this date, only fully supported by Firefox 31 and has been removed as an experimental feature in Google Chrome from version 33 to 34.\footnote{cf. \cite{cssvariables}}
To eliminate the duplication constants are sufficient.
Besides variables there are no native gls{css} means to emulate constants in their classical definition.

All common \gls{css}-Preprocessors provide a variable feature.
These variables are only variable during the actual processing and not at interpretation-time.
Thus preprocessor variables are effectively constants.\footnote{cf. \cite{wirthpreprocessors} p.27}

\section{Tight Coupling with Markup}
Some solutions apply or do not apply to specific programmaning styles and workflows
% There are multiple difference between the scoping module and prefixing rule selectors with another selector.
% However the biggest difference is absolute specifity, i.e. the cascade prioritize scoped styles.
% The following section introduces multiple methods to scope \gls{css} rules.
% All these methods work on information provided by the \gls{dom}.
% There are two observed established techniques to utilise rules scoped with prefixes.
